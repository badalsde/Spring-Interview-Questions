## Q1. What is Spring Boot? What are its advantages and disadvantages?
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework that provides a comprehensive platform for building enterprise-level web applications. It is built on top of the Spring Framework and offers a streamlined development process for Java developers. 

Spring Boot is designed to be easily configured and provides a number of out-of-the-box features that make it easier to create web applications. 

#### Advantages:
- Quick and easy to set up: Spring Boot provides a number of default settings and configurations, which makes it easy to set up and use.
- Reduced boilerplate code: Spring Boot automates many of the tasks such as configuration, security, and database access.
- Compatibility with other Spring modules: Developers can easily integrate it with other Spring projects.

#### Disadvantages:
- Steep learning curve: Although Spring Boot is designed to simplify web application development, it can still be challenging for new developers to learn. The framework has a lot of features and concepts that can be difficult to grasp at first.
- Limited customization: Spring Boot provides a lot of pre-configured settings, which can make it easy to get started quickly. However, some developers may find that the framework is not as flexible as they would like when it comes to customizing certain aspects of their application.
- Overhead: Spring Boot can add a bit of overhead to the application, as it includes a number of features and libraries that may not be necessary for some applications. This can slow down the application's performance.
