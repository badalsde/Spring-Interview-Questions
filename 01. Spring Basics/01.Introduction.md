    Basic Spring Conceptual Questions
</h1>

## Q1. What is Spring Boot? What are its advantages and disadvantages?
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework that provides a comprehensive platform for building enterprise-level web applications. It is built on top of the Spring Framework and offers a streamlined development process for Java developers. 

Spring Boot is designed to be easily configured and provides a number of out-of-the-box features that make it easier to create web applications. 

#### Advantages:
- Quick and easy to set up: Spring Boot provides a number of default settings and configurations, which makes it easy to set up and use.
- Reduced boilerplate code: Spring Boot automates many of the tasks such as configuration, security, and database access.
- Compatibility with other Spring modules: Developers can easily integrate it with other Spring projects.

#### Disadvantages:
- Steep learning curve: Although Spring Boot is designed to simplify web application development, it can still be challenging for new developers to learn. The framework has a lot of features and concepts that can be difficult to grasp at first.
- Limited customization: Spring Boot provides a lot of pre-configured settings, which can make it easy to get started quickly. However, some developers may find that the framework is not as flexible as they would like when it comes to customizing certain aspects of their application.
- Overhead: Spring Boot can add a bit of overhead to the application, as it includes a number of features and libraries that may not be necessary for some applications. This can slow down the application's performance.

## Q2. What are the differences between Spring and Spring Boot applications?
| Spring | Spring Boot |

|Main feature is dependency injection | Main feature is auto-configuration|
|Involves writing lots of boilerplate code | Reduces boilerplate code|
|Needs dependencies to be defined manually | Starters take care of dependencies|
|Involves setting up server manually | Includes embedded server like Tomcat and Jetty|


## Q3. What are the differences between Spring MVC and Spring Boot applications?
#### Spring Boot:
- Spring Boot is a module of Spring that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework to provide an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run.
- It provides default configurations to build Spring-powered framework.
- There is no need to build configuration manually.
- There is no requirement for a deployment descriptor.
- It avoids boilerplate code and wraps dependencies together in a single unit.
- It reduces development time and increases productivity.
- It provides powerful batch processing.

#### Spring MVC:
- A Spring MVC is a Java framework which is used to build web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
- A Spring MVC provides an elegant solution to use MVC in spring framework by the help of DispatcherServlet
- It provides ready to use features for building a web application.
- It requires build configuration manually.
- It requires Deployment descriptor is required.
- We need to specify each dependency separately.
- It does not provide powerful batch processing.
 

## Q4. What  is called Inversion of Control?
- Inversion of Control (IoC) is a principle of software design that refers to the transfer of control over the execution of a software component or system from the component or system itself to an external framework. 
- The Spring framework is built on this principle, which is why it is often referred to as an IoC container. In Spring, the responsibility for managing the lifecycle of objects and controlling their dependencies is moved from the application code to the Spring container. 
- This principle is called "inversion of control" because it involves the inversion of the responsibility of the application object's creation, initialization, and destruction from the application to the third party such as the framework. Now the third party takes care of application object management and dependencies thereby making an application easy to maintain, test, and reuse.

## Q5. Compare BeanFactory with ApplicationContext?
- Bean Factory and Application Context are both important components of the Spring Framework. However, there are some differences between them in terms of their features and capabilities.
- Bean Factory is the basic container in the Spring Framework that provides the fundamental functionality for managing and wiring beans. It provides basic dependency injection capabilities and manages the lifecycle of beans. Bean Factory is a lightweight container that is suitable for small and simple applications.
- On the other hand, Application Context is a more advanced container that builds on the functionality provided by the Bean Factory. Application Context is a heavier container that is suitable for larger and more complex applications.

Here are some key differences between Bean Factory and Application Context:

- **Configuration:** Bean Factory uses XML-based configuration, while Application Context provides more advanced configuration options, including XML, Java annotations, and Java code.
- **Lifecycle:** Bean Factory supports basic bean lifecycle management, while Application Context provides more advanced features such as automatic bean post-processing and lifecycle events.
- **Internationalization:** Application Context provides support for internationalization, while Bean Factory does not.
- **AOP:** Application Context provides support for AOP, while Bean Factory does not.
- **Integration:** Application Context provides integration with other frameworks such as Struts and Hibernate, while Bean Factory does not.
 

## Q6. What are the steps involved in creating a new Spring Boot application from scratch, and how does the Spring Initializer tool help in this process?
Creating a new Spring Boot application from scratch involves the following steps:
 
1. Use Spring Initializr: Spring Initializr is a web-based tool provided by Spring that helps generate the initial structure and configuration for a Spring Boot application. It allows you to select the project metadata (e.g., group, artifact), build system (Maven ), language (Java), and dependencies you want to include in your application.
2. Download the Project: After configuring the project details and dependencies, you can generate and download the project as a ZIP file.
3. Import the Project: Import the downloaded project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Spring Tool Suite (STS).
4. Explore the Project Structure: Examine the generated project structure, which typically includes the following:
    1. src/main/java: Contains the application's Java source code. 
    2. src/main/resources: Holds the application's configuration files, static resources, and other non-code assets. 
    3. src/test/java: Contains the unit and integration test cases. 
    4. pom.xml (for Maven): The build configuration file that manages dependencies and build-related tasks.
5. Modify the Application: Customize the generated @SpringBootApplication class or create new classes, components, and configurations as needed for your application's requirements.
6. Run the Application: Spring Boot applications can be run directly from the IDE.


## Q7. Explain the flow of a request in a Spring Boot application, from the controller layer to the repository layer.
In a Spring Boot application, the typical flow of a request from the controller layer to the repository layer follows this pattern:

1. The client sends an HTTP request to the application.
2. The request is received by the appropriate controller method, annotated with @RequestMapping or related annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.
3. The controller method may call one or more service layer methods, which encapsulate the business logic.
4. The service layer methods may interact with repository layer components (e.g., classes annotated with @Repository) to perform database operations like querying, inserting, updating, or deleting data.
5. The repository layer interacts with the configured data source (e.g., a database) using data access technologies like Spring Data JPA, JDBC, or other data access frameworks.
6. The repository layer returns the requested data or persists the changes to the data source.
7. The service layer receives the data from the repository layer and performs any necessary business logic or transformations.
8. The service layer returns the processed data to the controller.
9. The controller prepares the response, which may involve mapping the data to a view (for web applications) or converting it to a suitable format like JSON or XML (for RESTful APIs).
10. The response is sent back to the client.

This flow highlights the separation of concerns between the different layers of the application and showcases how Spring Boot facilitates the development of modular and well-structured applications.
 

## Q8. Describe the overall flow of a Spring Boot application. 
The overall flow of a Spring Boot application typically follows these steps:
 
1. The application is initialized, and the Spring Boot's auto-configuration process kicks in, automatically configuring various components based on the dependencies present in the project.
2. The @SpringBootApplication class, which is the entry point of the application, is executed.
3. Spring Boot creates and initializes the application context, registering all the necessary beans and components.
4. Any custom configurations or additional beans are registered in the application context.
5. The application context is refreshed, and all the registered beans are instantiated and wired together using dependency injection.
6. The application is ready to receive and handle incoming requests.
7. When a request is received, it is routed to the appropriate controller method based on the configured URL mappings.
8. The controller method may interact with various service layer components and repository layer components to fulfill the request.
9. The response is prepared and sent back to the client.
10. The application continues to run, handling subsequent requests in a similar fashion until it is terminated or restarted.

This flow emphasizes the auto-configuration capabilities of Spring Boot, the creation and initialization of the application context, and the overall lifecycle of handling requests in a typical Spring Boot application


## Q9. How can you change the default server port in a Spring Boot application?
To change the default server port in a Spring Boot application, you can follow these steps:
 
    1. Open the application.properties or application.yml file in your project's src/main/resources directory.
    2. Add the following property: server.port=<desired_port_number> (e.g., server.port=8081).
    3. Save the file, and restart your Spring Boot application.

After making this change, your Spring Boot application will start running on the specified port instead of the default port (8080).
Alternatively, you can also set the server port programmatically by creating a @Bean method in a configuration class and returning an instance of ServerProperties with the desired port number.


## Q10. What is Spring framework? (In one line) 
Spring framework is a popular open-source application framework that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for developing robust, scalable, and loosely-coupled Java applications.


## Q11. How many modules we have in Spring? Explain .
The Spring framework consists of around 20 modules, but the 7 core modules are:

- Spring Core: Provides the fundamental parts of the framework, including the IoC and Dependency Injection features.
- Spring Context: Builds on the Core module and provides a way to access objects in a configurable manner.
- Spring AOP: Enables Aspect-Oriented Programming, which allows for separating cross-cutting concerns.
- Spring Web: Provides basic web-oriented integration features like multipart file upload and initialization of the IoC container using servlets listeners and a web-oriented application context.
- Spring MVC: The Model-View-Controller implementation for building web applications and RESTful services.
- Spring DAO: Provides a JDBC-abstraction layer that simplifies data access logic.
- Spring ORM: Provides integration layers for popular object-relational mapping APIs, including JPA and Hibernate.


 ## Q12. What is Spring MVC?
 Spring MVC is a web application framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Spring MVC provides a structured and extensible framework for web application development, promoting separation of concerns and offering various features out of the box.

Its key components and features are:

- DispatcherServlet: Front controller that handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates to controllers.
- Controllers: Handle requests, process data, interact with models, and return views.
- Models: Represent application data and business logic.
- Views: Render the user interface based on model data (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
- Request Mapping: Annotations (@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping) map requests to controller methods.
- Data Binding: Automatic binding of request parameters to controller method arguments.
- Interceptors: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and security.
- Exception Handling: Consistent exception handling with @ExceptionHandler and global handlers.
- Validation: Integration with Java Bean Validation API for form data validation.
- Internationalization and Localization: Support for resource bundles and localized views.


## Q13. What are the design patterns used in Spring? 
Some of the key design patterns used in Spring Framework, are

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:
    - The Spring MVC framework is built around the MVC architectural pattern, separating the application logic into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.
    - The Model represents the data and business logic.
    - The View is responsible for rendering the user interface based on the data provided by the Model.
    - The Controller handles incoming requests, interacts with the Model, and selects the appropriate View to render.
 
2. Factory Method Pattern: 
    - Spring utilizes the Factory Method pattern to create objects dynamically.
    - This pattern involves a factory class with an abstract method for creating objects of a specific type. Subclasses can then extend the factory to create different types of objects based on configuration or application state.
    - Spring's BeanFactory and ApplicationContext interfaces are core implementations of this pattern, enabling the creation and management of beans (objects) within the Spring container.
 
3. Singleton Pattern:
    - The Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container creates and manages singleton instances of beans by default.
    - This ensures that only one instance of a bean is created and shared throughout the application.
 
4. Proxy Pattern:
    - Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) heavily utilizes the Proxy pattern to apply aspects (cross-cutting concerns) to target objects.
    - When an aspect is configured to be applied to a class or method, Spring creates a proxy object that wraps the target object.
    - The proxy object intercepts the method calls and applies the aspects (advice) around the method execution.
 
5. Template Method Pattern:
    - Spring provides various template classes that define the basic skeleton of an operation, allowing developers to override specific steps as needed.
    - Examples include JdbcTemplate, RestTemplate, and TransactionTemplate
