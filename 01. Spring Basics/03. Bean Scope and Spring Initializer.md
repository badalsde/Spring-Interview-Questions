  Bean Scope and Spring Initializer Conceptual Questions
</h1>

## Q1. Explain scope of the bean? Which is the default scope.
- A bean scope in Spring defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean instance. The various types of bean scopes are
- **Singleton:** It means that only one instance of the bean will be created for the entire application context, and that instance will be shared by all components that depend on it.
- **Prototype:** In this scope, a new instance of the bean will be created every time it is requested from the container. This means that multiple instances of the bean can coexist in the application context, and each instance will be independent of the others.
- Request, Session, and Global Session. The choice of scope controls how many instances of the bean will be created and how long they will last.
Singleton is the default scope for a bean in Spring.


## Q2. Are all Spring beans singleton?
- No, not everything is a singleton in Spring. By default, Spring beans are singleton-scoped, which means that only one instance of a bean is created and shared throughout the entire application context. However, we can configure beans to have a different scope, such as prototype, request, session, or global session.
- When a bean is defined as a prototype, a new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested from the container.
- On the other hand, request, session, and global session scopes are used in web applications to create beans that are specific to a particular HTTP request, session, or global session, respectively.


## Q3. What is the difference between Spring Singleton bean and Singleton Design pattern?
The main differences between Spring Singleton Beans and the Singleton Design Pattern are:

- **Management:** Spring Singleton Beans are managed by the Spring framework, while the Singleton Design Pattern is managed by the class itself.
- **Implementation:** Spring Singleton Beans are implemented as managed beans in the application context, while the Singleton Design Pattern can be implemented using different approaches, such as a private constructor or a static method.
- **Scope:** Spring Singleton Beans have a scope that is limited to the Spring application context, while the Singleton Design Pattern can have a global scope, accessible from any part of the application.

Spring Singleton Beans and the Singleton Design Pattern both create a single instance of an object, but they differ in their management, implementation, and scope.


## Q4. Can a singleton bean have reference to prototype bean, how many beans will be created?
Yes, a Singleton bean can have a reference to a Prototype bean in Spring. When a Singleton bean is created, it gets a reference to the Prototype bean, and every time the Singleton bean is called, it will get a new instance of the Prototype bean. However, only one instance of the Singleton bean will be created, as per the Singleton design pattern. 


## Q5. What are the advantages of using springboot initializer to create a new springboot project?
The advantages of using Spring Boot Initializer to create a new Spring Boot project are:

- it saves time by generating a project with pre-configured dependencies and configurations.
- it provides an easy-to-use interface with documentation and examples.
- it allows for flexibility in choosing project options and dependencies.
- it generates projects that follow best practices, and it helps reduce errors during development.


## Q6. What is spring boot initializer?How to create a new springboot project using springboot initializer?
Spring Boot Initializr is a web-based tool that helps developers create new Spring Boot projects with ease. It allows developers to quickly generate a basic project structure with the necessary dependencies and configurations.

To create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Boot Initializer, follow these steps:

- Open your web browser and navigate to  [Spring Initlizer](https://start.spring.io/).
- Choose the desired options for your project, including the project type (Maven or Gradle), the language (Java, Kotlin, or Groovy), the Spring Boot version, and the packaging type (jar or war).
- Enter the required project metadata, such as the Group and Artifact IDs, and the project name.
- Select the dependencies you want to include in your project. Spring Boot Initializr provides a wide range of dependencies, including Web, Data, Security, and many more.
- Click the "Generate" button to download a zip file containing your new Spring Boot project.

Once you have downloaded the project, you can import it into your favorite IDE and start working on your application. Spring Boot Initializr provides a great way to get started quickly with a new Spring Boot project, without having to manually configure dependencies and project settings.
