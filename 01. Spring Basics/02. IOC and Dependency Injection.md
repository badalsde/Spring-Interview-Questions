 IOC and Dependency Injection Conceptual Questions
</h1>

## Q1. What is an IOC Container?
- In Spring, an IOC (Inversion of Control) Container is a software component that manages the instantiation and lifecycle of objects (or beans) in an application.
- The IOC container achieves this by creating a centralized registry of objects, and it's responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling these objects.
- The Spring IOC container works by using a technique called Dependency Injection.
- The benefits of using the Spring IOC container include loose coupling between objects, easier testing, and increased flexibility and scalability of the application.

Spring provides two types of containers

  #### BeanFactory:
  - org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory is the main interface representing a BeanFactory container.

  #### ApplicationContext:
  - org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext is the main Interface representing an ApplicationContext container. 
  - It inherits the BeanFactory features and provides added features to support enterprise services such as internationalization, validation, etc.
