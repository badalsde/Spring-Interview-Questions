## Q1. What is Rest API?
- REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a type of web service that allows communication between different software systems over the internet.
- It is based on the principles of the REST architectural style, which defines a set of constraints for creating scalable and maintainable web services.
- REST APIs use HTTP requests to retrieve and send data in a standardized format, such as JSON or XML. They are designed to be stateless, meaning that each request contains all the necessary information to complete the request, and the server does not store any session data between requests. REST APIs are widely used in web and mobile applications to access and manipulate data from remote servers.
