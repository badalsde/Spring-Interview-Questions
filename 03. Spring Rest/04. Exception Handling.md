  Exception Handling Conceptual Questions

## Q1. What is @RestControllerAdvice?
- @RestControllerAdvice is an extension of the @ControllerAdvice annotation in Spring MVC that is specifically designed for RESTful web services.
- Similar to @ControllerAdvice, @RestControllerAdvice allows you to write global code that can be applied to all @RestController or specific @RestController in your application. However, the difference is that @RestControllerAdvice applies to the RESTful web services endpoints that return a response in the format of JSON, XML, or any other format that is not tied to the view.
- The @RestControllerAdvice class can handle exceptions that are thrown by the REST controllers or add common model attributes or request headers to all RESTful web service responses. It is a convenient way to implement cross-cutting concerns such as error handling and response transformation for RESTful web services.


## Q2. What is @ControllerAdvice in Spring REST?
**@ControllerAdvice** is an annotation in the Spring Framework that is used to define global exception handling for a Spring MVC application. It allows us to define a centralized error handling mechanism that can be used across multiple controllers in our application.

  - When a class is annotated with @ControllerAdvice, it indicates that the class will handle exceptions thrown by controller methods in our Spring MVC application. we can define methods within the class that handle specific types of exceptions, and these methods will be invoked when an exception of the corresponding type is thrown.
  - The @ControllerAdvice annotation can be used in conjunction with other annotations, such as @ExceptionHandler, @InitBinder, and @ModelAttribute, to provide a comprehensive exception handling and data binding mechanism for our application.

For example, consider the following Spring controller advice class:

```

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(value = {Exception.class})
  public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception ex) {
    return new ResponseEntity<>("An error occurred: " + ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
  }
}

```

In this example, the @ControllerAdvice annotation indicates that this class will handle exceptions thrown by controller methods in the Spring MVC application. The @ExceptionHandler annotation specifies that the handleException() method will handle exceptions of type Exception, and return a custom error message and HTTP status code in the response. This method can be used to handle any exceptions of type Exception that are thrown by any controller method in the application.

## Q3. How to handle exception(s) in a Spring Boot application?
In Spring Boot, exceptions can be handled using the @ExceptionHandler annotation, which provides a way to handle exceptions at a global level or at the controller level.

Here's how to handle exceptions in Spring Boot:
  - Create an exception class that extends RuntimeException or any other appropriate exception type.
  - Define an exception handler method in your controller class using the @ExceptionHandler annotation. The method should have the exception class as its argument.
  - Within the handler method, you can define how to handle the exception, such as returning an error message or redirecting to an error page.
  - If you want to handle exceptions globally across all controllers, you can define a class that implements the ErrorController interface and provides a method for handling all exceptions.
  - You can also use the @ControllerAdvice /@RestControllerAdvice annotation to create a global exception handler that can handle exceptions for multiple controllers.

By handling exceptions in Spring Boot, you can provide a better user experience and prevent your application from crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
