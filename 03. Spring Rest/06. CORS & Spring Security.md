  CORS & Spring Security Conceptual Questions
</h1>

## Q1. What is CORS? How can you configure CORS in Spring Boot to allow cross-origin requests?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature built into web browsers that restricts cross-domain requests. When a web application running on one domain tries to access a resource (such as an API endpoint) on another domain, the browser may block the request due to the same-origin policy. To enable cross-domain requests, the server needs to include appropriate CORS headers in the response.

In Spring REST, there are several ways to enable CORS support, including:

  - Using **@CrossOrigin annotation:** You can enable CORS support for a controller method by adding the @CrossOrigin annotation. This annotation allows you to specify the allowed origins, methods, and headers for the request.
  - Using **WebMvcConfigurer:** You can also enable CORS support for all endpoints by adding a CorsConfiguration to WebMvcConfigurer.

## Q2. Explain spring security
Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It provides a comprehensive set of security features to protect web applications from attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), session fixation, and more.

Some of the key features of Spring Security are:

  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Session management
  - CSRF protection
  - Security headers
  - Integration with other Spring projects


## Q3. How to apply basic authentication to your Spring REST applications?
Spring Security is a powerful framework that provides authentication and authorization features for Spring-based applications, including REST APIs. Here are the general steps to handle application authentication and security using Spring Security for REST APIs:

  - Add Spring Security dependencies to your project
  - Configure Spring Security in your application

We can enable Spring Security by annotating the configuration class with @EnableWebSecurity. We can also override the configure(HttpSecurity) method to define our security policy.

We can permit as per the requirement the GET/POST requests to any endpoint say, under /public and requiring authentication for all other requests. We can use HTTP Basic authentication to authenticate users.

Finally, we can override the configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder) method to specify a custom UserDetailsService that will load user information from a database.

## Q4. What are the different authentications that can be used to secure REST APIs?
Here are some of the different authentication mechanisms that can be used with Spring Security to secure REST APIs:

**Basic Authentication:** This is a simple authentication mechanism where the client sends the username and password in the HTTP headers with each request. Spring Security provides out-of-the-box support for Basic Authentication.

**Form-based Authentication:** This mechanism allows users to authenticate using a form-based login page. Spring Security provides support for form-based authentication.

**Certificate-based Authentication:** This authentication mechanism is based on X.509 certificates, where clients present a certificate to authenticate.

**Token-based Authentication:** This authentication mechanism uses a token that is generated on the server and sent to the client, which is then sent with each subsequent request. Various token-based authentication mechanisms, including JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth2.

  - **OAuth2:** It allows clients to access resources on behalf of a resource owner. It provides mechanisms for authorization, token management, and more.
  - **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** JWT is a token-based authentication mechanism that allows clients to authenticate using a signed token.

**Digest Authentication:** This authentication mechanism is similar to Basic Authentication but with an additional MD5 hash for the password.


## Q5. How do you configure Swagger for Spring REST API in spring boot application?
Swagger is an open-source tool for building and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a user interface that allows developers to interact with and test the API, as well as generate documentation for the API.

Here are the steps to configure Swagger for a Spring REST API in a Spring Boot application:

- Add the Swagger dependencies to your project:
- Create a configuration class to configure Swagger:
- Annotate your controller methods with Swagger annotations to document the API:
- Run the application and access the Swagger UI:
