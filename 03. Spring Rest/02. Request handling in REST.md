  Request handling in REST Conceptual Questions
</h1>

## Q1. What are JAX-RS Annotations?
**@Path:** It is used to specify the relative path of a resource class or method.

for example, /helloworld. You can also embed variables in the URIs to make a URI path template. For example, you could ask for the name of a user and pass it to the application as a variable in the URI: /helloworld/{username}.

However, in Spring REST, the @Path annotation is not used. Instead, Spring REST uses the @RequestMapping annotation to map HTTP requests to handler methods.

**@Get:** It is a request method designator and corresponds to the similarly named HTTP method. The Java method annotated @Get will process HTTP GET requests.

**@Post:** It is a request method designator and corresponds to the similarly named HTTP method. The Java method annotated with @Post will process HTTP POST requests.

**@Put:** It is a request method designator and corresponds to the similarly named HTTP method. The Java method annotated with @Put will process HTTP PUT requests.

**@Produces:** It is used to specify the MIME media types or representations a resource can produce and send back to the client. If @Produces is applied at the class level, all the methods in a resource can produce the specified MIME types by default. If it is applied at the method level, it overrides any @Produces annotations applied at the class level.

If no methods in a resource are able to produce the MIME type in a client request, the Jersey runtime sends back an HTTP “406 Not Acceptable” error.

The value of @Produces is an array of String of MIME types.For example:

@Produces({"image/jpeg,image/png"})

**@Consumes:** It is used to specify which MIME media types of representations a resource can accept, or consume, from the client. If @Consumes is applied at the class level, all the response methods accept the specified MIME types by default. If @Consumes is applied at the method level, it overrides any @Consumes annotations applied at the class level.

If a resource is unable to consume the MIME type of a client request, the Jersey runtime sends back an HTTP “415 Unsupported Media Type” error.

The value of @Consumes is an array of String of acceptable MIME types. For example:

@Consumes({"text/plain,text/html"})
