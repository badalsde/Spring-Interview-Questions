  Handling URI Data Conceptual Questions
</h1>

## Q1. How do you write REST API URI in Spring?
In Spring, you can write REST API URI using the @RequestMapping annotation. Here's an example:

```

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
   @GetMapping("/{id}")
   public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
       // code to retrieve user by id
   }
   @PostMapping
   public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
       // code to create a new user
   }
   @PutMapping("/{id}")
   public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
       // code to update an existing user
   }
   @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
   public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
       // code to delete a user by id
   }
}

```

In this example, the @RequestMapping annotation is used to specify the base URI for all the endpoints in the UserController class. The @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping annotations are used to specify the HTTP verbs for the corresponding endpoints. The @PathVariable annotation is used to extract the value of a path variable from the URI, and the @RequestBody annotation is used to extract the request body from the HTTP request.

By using these annotations and many other annotations defined in Spring REST, you can easily define REST API endpoints in Spring and map them to the appropriate HTTP verbs and URIs.

## Q2. What is ResponseEntity, why and when is it used?
ResponseEntity is a class that represents an HTTP response, including the status code, headers, and body. It's typically used to return a response from a request handler method in a Spring REST controller.

Here are some scenarios where you might use ResponseEntity:

**To return a custom HTTP status code:**
  - By default, Spring maps the return value of a request handler method to the response body and sets the HTTP status code to 200 (OK). If you need to return a different status code, you can use ResponseEntity to specify the status code explicitly.
  - For example, you could return a ResponseEntity<String> with a status code of 404 (Not Found) to indicate that a requested resource was not found.

**To set response headers:**
  - We can use ResponseEntity to set response headers, such as Content-Type or Cache-Control.
  - For example, you could return a ResponseEntity<byte[]> with a Content-Type header of application/pdf to return a PDF file in the response.

**To return an empty response body:**
  - If you need to return a response with an empty body, you can use ResponseEntity<Void> to indicate that the response body should be empty.
  - For example, you could return a ResponseEntity<Void> with a status code of 204 (No Content) to indicate that a request was successful but had no response body.    

## Q3. What are the different Media Types?
Media types, also known as MIME types, are standardized identifiers for file formats and data types used on the internet. They are used by web servers to identify the format of the data being transferred, allowing web browsers to interpret and display the data correctly.

Hereâ€™s are some commonly used media types:

- **application/json:** It represents and transmits data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
- **application/xml:** It represents and transmits data in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format.
- **multipart:** It allows transfer of multiple parts of data in a single request, often used for file uploads.
- **application/octet-stream:** A binary format used for transferring data, often used for sending binary data like images, audio, or video.
- **text/xml:** It represents and transmits data in XML format, but specifically for textual data.
- **text/html:** It represents and transmits hypertext documents, used to create web pages and display them in web browsers.
- **image/jpeg:** A format for compressing and storing digital images, commonly used for photographs on the web.


## Q4. What are Query params? What are Path variables? When do you use them?
Query parameters and Path variables are two common ways to pass data or information to a REST API endpoint.

#### Query parameters:
- These are additional values appended to the URL of a request after a ? symbol. They are used to specify additional options or data to be sent along with the request.
- Query parameters do not affect the resource path, and can be added, removed or modified without affecting the resource being requested.
- Query parameters are commonly used for filtering or sorting resources, pagination, or specifying search terms.

Example URL with query parameters:

  https://example.com/api/users?gender=female&age=25&page=2

#### Path variables:
- These are variables embedded in the path of the URL of a request.
- They are used to specify a unique identifier or value that is specific to the requested resource.
- Path variables affect the resource path and cannot be changed without affecting the resource being requested.
- Path variables are commonly used to identify and retrieve a specific resource, or to provide context to the requested resource.

Example URL with path variables:

https://example.com/api/users/1234

In general, query parameters should be used for optional or additional data that does not directly identify a resource, while path variables should be used for mandatory or required data that identifies a specific resource


## Q5. What is the difference between @PathParam vs @RequestParam
- @PathVariable and @RequestParam are used to handle HTTP requests with dynamic parameters.
- @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URI of the request, while @RequestParam is used to extract values from the query string of the request.

## Q6. What should be the URI when user wants to list a user detail from the database and what should be the method signature of the method in controller?
The URI for listing a user detail from the database should be /users/{userId} where {userId} is the unique identifier of the user.

The method signature of the controller method that handles this request in a Spring REST application can be as follows:

```

@GetMapping("/users/{userId}")
public ResponseEntity<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long userId) {
    // Code to retrieve user details from the database
}

```

## Q7. How do you retrieve values from the URL with parameters in a Spring Boot application?
In a Spring Boot application, you can retrieve values from the URL with parameters using the following approaches:

1. Request Parameters with @RequestParam:
    - Annotate the method parameter with @RequestParam("paramName") to bind the request parameter value to the method parameter.
    - Example: <br>
        public String handleRequest(@RequestParam("id") int id, @RequestParam("name") String name)
 
2. Path Variables with @PathVariable:
     - Define path variables in the request mapping URL pattern using curly braces {}.
     - Annotate the method parameter with @PathVariable("variableName") to bind the path variable value to the method parameter.
     - Example:<br>
         - Request Mapping:  @GetMapping("/books/{id}/{category}")
         - Method: public Book getBook(@PathVariable("id") int id, @PathVariable("category") String category)
 
3. @RequestBody for JSON/XML data:
     - Annotate the method parameter with @RequestBody to automatically deserialize the incoming request body and bind it to the method parameter object.
     - Example: public Book createBook(@RequestBody Book book)

The recommended way is to use @RequestParam for simple request parameters and @PathVariable for path variables in the URL. For complex data types in the request body, use @RequestBody.
