   Spring Microservices Basic Conceptual Questions
</h1>

## Q1. What are Microservices?
Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

- Independently deployable
- Loosely coupled
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably - a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

## Q2. Explain Monolithic Architecture
- An architecture that structures the application as a single deployable/executable component that uses a single database.
- The component contains all of the application’s subdomains

 ## Q3. What are the drawbacks of Monolithic Architecture?
- Difficult to understand and maintain due its the application’s size and complexity.
- Potentially less team autonomy - all teams are contributed to the same code base so they need to coordinate their work more often.
- Potentially slow deployment pipeline - since there’s a single large application that needs to be built and tested.
- Single technology stack - the application uses a single technology stack, which might not be ideal for all subdomains. If it the application is large upgrading the technology stack might be very time consuming.
- No possibility of segregating subdomains by their characteristics, which might reduce scalability, availabilty, security etc

 ## Q4. What are the different ways that services can communicate?
the different ways that services can communicate are:
- Messaging
- Remote Procedure Invocation


## Q5. Explain Messaging.
Messaging/ asynchronous messaging is used for inter-service communication. Services communicating by exchanging messages over messaging channels.

There are several different styles of asynchronous communication:

- Request/response - a service sends a request message to a recipient and expects to receive a reply message promptly
- Notifications - a sender sends a message a recipient but does not expect a reply. Nor is one sent.
- Request/asynchronous response - a service sends a request message to a recipient and expects to receive a reply message eventually
- Publish/subscribe - a service publishes a message to zero or more recipients
- Publish/asynchronous response - a service publishes a request to one or recipients, some of whom send back a reply

There are numerous examples of asynchronous messaging technologies.

- Apache Kafka
- Rabbit MQ

## Q6. Explain Remote Procedure Invocation (RPI)
RPI is used  for inter-service communication. The client uses a request/reply-based protocol to make requests to a service.

There are numerous examples of RPI technologies.
- REST
- Grpc
- Apache Thrift
